  </header>
  <article>
    <p><strong>Interested? <a href="https://utwentecareers.nl/en/vacancies/1917/phd-position-on-explainable-incident-response-tuccr/">Apply here</a>. Deadline is October 6th, 2024</strong> (Position filled)</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p><em>Are you interested in interpretable machine learning for cybersecurity, and want to empower security practitioners 
by improving the current state of cyber incident response? The Semantics, Cybersecurity, and Services (SCS) group at the University of Twente 
and the Twente University Centre for Cybersecurity Research (TUCCR) 
invites applications for a fully funded PhD Position in Explainable Incident Response.</em></p>

<p>Analysts working in Security Operations Centres (SOCs) investigate thousands of alerts on a daily basis, often leading to burnout and fatigue. 
In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution to automate the workflows of SOC analysts. However, analysts are 
often contractually obligated to investigate all alerts, thus, making it critical that they are able to understand how such ML-based solutions 
work.</p>

<p>The objective of this PhD project is to create ‘AI-assisted practitioners’ for incident response by developing novel human-in-the-loop ML 
algorithms that reduce analyst workload and provide decision-making assistance <a class="citation" href="#nadeem2023sok">(Nadeem et al., 2023)</a>. We propose to develop explainable ML algorithms that summarize 
large volumes of observable data (intrusion alerts, network &amp; system logs) in order to discover contextually meaningful patterns from them <a class="citation" href="#nadeem2021sage3">(Nadeem et al., 2021)</a>.
The student will conduct fundamental research and explore various learning paradigms to develop actionable explanations from these discovered patterns 
that are tailored to the operator’s expertise.</p>

<p>The evaluation of these algorithms will be done under closed-world and open-world settings. For the 
closed-world setting, a major challenge is the lack of suitable datasets to evaluate ML models <a class="citation" href="#rimmer2021open">(Rimmer et al., 2022)</a>. The student will set up a testbed together with 
our industry collaborators for the collection of intrusion alert datasets. For the open-world setting, the student will deploy these algorithms 
in real SOC environments in order to measure the extent of workload reduction experienced by the analysts. In doing so, we aim to develop 
technologies that are not only novel but also have real-world applications.</p>

<p>The PhD student will be embedded within the Semantics, Cybersecurity, and Services (SCS) group at University of Twente. 
The student will have the opportunity to participate in internships and/or collaboration with industry partners under the TUCCR initiative. 
The SCS group offers a stimulating, supportive, and diverse research environment, as well as plenty of opportunities for personal and professional growth.</p>

<p><strong>Your profile:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You are a highly motivated and enthusiastic researcher, aspiring to do world-class research and have real-world impact.</li>
  <li>You have a MSc degree with excellent grades in computer science, or similar, with a special emphasis on cybersecurity and/or 
artificial intelligence; Applications from students who are about to finish their MSc degree studies will be considered as well.</li>
  <li>You are interested in the domain of cybersecurity and explainability;</li>
  <li>You have a solid background in artificial intelligence and/or cybersecurity; Some industrial experience in an incident response role and prior experience with writing scientific papers are of additional advantage.</li>
  <li>You know your way around UNIX/Linux systems; You can code in Python and know your war around sklearn and tensorflow.</li>
  <li>You are curious and interested in learning how things work and how to make them better.</li>
  <li>You have a creative mind-set and excellent analytical and communication skills.</li>
  <li>You have good team spirit and like to work in an interdisciplinary and internationally oriented environment;</li>
  <li>You are proficient in English.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Our offer:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>As a PhD candidate at UT, you will be appointed to a full-time position for four years, with a qualifier in the first year, within a very stimulating and exciting scientific environment.</li>
  <li>The University offers a dynamic ecosystem with enthusiastic colleagues.</li>
  <li>Your salary and associated conditions are in accordance with the collective labour agreement for Dutch universities (CAO-NU).</li>
  <li>There are excellent benefits including a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%, and a solid pension scheme.</li>
  <li>The flexibility to work (partially) from home.</li>
  <li>A minimum of 232 leave hours in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A full-time employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.</li>
  <li>Free access to sports facilities on campus.</li>
  <li>A family-friendly institution that offers parental leave (both paid and unpaid).</li>
  <li>You will have a training programme as part of the Twente Graduate School where you and your supervisors will determine a plan for a suitable education and supervision.</li>
  <li>We encourage a high degree of responsibility and independence, while collaborating with close colleagues, researchers and other staff.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a promising solution to improve the transparency of machine learning (ML) pipelines. We systematize the increasingly growing (but fragmented) microcosm of studies that develop and utilize XAI methods for defensive and offensive cybersecurity tasks. We identify 3 cybersecurity stakeholders, i.e., model users, designers, and adversaries, that utilize XAI for 5 different objectives within an ML pipeline, namely 1) XAI-enabled decision support, 2) applied XAI for security tasks, 3) model verification via XAI, 4) explanation verification & robustness, and 5) offensive use of explanations. We further classify the literature w.r.t. the targeted security domain. Our analysis of the literature indicates that many of the XAI applications are designed with little understanding of how they might be integrated into analyst workflows – user studies for explanation evaluation are conducted in only 14% of the cases. The literature also rarely disentangles the role of the various stakeholders. Particularly, the role of the model designer is minimized within the security literature. To this end, we present an illustrative use case accentuating the role of model designers. We demonstrate cases where XAI can help in model verification and cases where it may lead to erroneous conclusions instead. The systematization and use case enable us to challenge several assumptions and present open problems that can help shape the future of XAI within cybersecurity.</p>

      <p>Ideal cyber threat intelligence (CTI) includes insights into attacker strategies that are specific to a network under observation. Such CTI currently requires extensive expert input for obtaining, assessing, and correlating system vulnerabilities into a graphical representation, often referred to as an attack graph (AG). Instead of deriving AGs based on system vulnerabilities, this work advocates the direct use of intrusion alerts. We propose SAGE, an explainable sequence learning pipeline that automatically constructs AGs from intrusion alerts without a priori expert knowledge. SAGE exploits the temporal and probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton (S-PDFA) — a model that brings infrequent severe alerts into the spotlight and summarizes paths leading to them. Attack graphs are extracted from the model on a per-victim, per-objective basis. SAGE is thoroughly evaluated on three open-source intrusion alert datasets collected through security testing competitions in order to analyze distributed multi-stage attacks. SAGE compresses over 330k alerts into 93 AGs that show how specific attacks transpired. The AGs are succinct, interpretable, and provide directly relevant insights into strategic differences and fingerprintable paths. They even show that attackers tend to follow shorter paths after they have discovered a longer one in 84.5% of the cases.</p>

      <p>This chapter contributes to the ongoing discussion of strengthening security by applying AI techniques in the scope of intrusion detection. The focus is set on open-world detection of attacks through
data-driven network traffic analysis. This research topic is complementary to the earlier chapter on intelligent malware detection. In this chapter, we revisit the foundations of machine learning-based
solutions for network security, which aim to make network defense tools more autonomous, adaptive, proactive and responsive. Specifically, we
give a comprehensive introduction to the research on anomaly detection for network intrusion detection – that is, defensive schemes that do
not assume complete prior knowledge of malicious patterns and instead learn the notion of normality from benign traffic. Along with outlining the recent advances in the field, we provide insights and reflect on
the current limitations and research challenges. Therefore, this chapter presents compelling research opportunities to advance machine learning
techniques in network security and push the boundaries of open-world network intrusion detection.</p>
