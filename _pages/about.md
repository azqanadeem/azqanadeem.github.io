I am an Assistant Professor at [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/) 
in the [Semantics, Cybersecurity, and Services (SCS) group](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/scs/). 
My research focuses on <b class="main-name"><i>explainable machine learning solutions for cyber security tasks</i></b> such as incident response, malware analysis, 
and intrusion detection. My mission is to go beyond prediction probabilities, and extract semantically meaningful insights from 
ML models (especially under unsupervised settings with complex structured data). 


Before joining UT, I was a PhD candidate/lecturer at TU Delft. 
During my PhD, I developed several *explainable sequential machine learning tool-chains* for automating cyber threat intelligence.
These tool-chains extracted actionable insights from large volumes of cyber data in order to assist security analysts in understanding adversary behavior. 

Next to research, I also spent 40% of my time developing and teaching cyber security lectures to BSc. (Computer Science and Engineering) students at TU Delft.
I wrote about my teaching experience [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07625), 
and the teaching material can be found under [Cyber Security Lecture Series](https://azqanadeem.github.io/teaching/). 


Outside of work, I love photography, painting, and traveling. I enjoy discussions about human psychology, 
neurodivergence, cats, imposter syndrome, and... well... cats.
