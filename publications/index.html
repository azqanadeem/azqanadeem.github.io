      <p>Although many Computer Science (CS) programs offer cybersecurity courses, they are typically optional and placed at the periphery of the program. We advocate to integrate cybersecurity as a crosscutting concept in CS curricula, which is also consistent with latest cybersecurity curricular guidelines, e.g., CSEC2017. We describe our experience of implementing this crosscutting intervention across three undergraduate core CS courses at a leading technical university in Europe between 2018 and 2023, collectively educating over 2200 students. The security education was incorporated within CS courses using a partnership between the responsible course instructor and a security expert, i.e., the security expert (after consultation with course instructors) developed and taught lectures covering multiple CSEC2017 knowledge areas. This created a complex dynamic between three stakeholders: the course instructor, the security expert, and the students. We reflect on our intervention from the perspective of the three stakeholders â€“ we conducted a post-course survey to collect student perceptions, and semi-supervised interviews with responsible course instructors and the security expert to gauge their experience. We found that while the students were extremely enthusiastic about the security content and retained its impact several years later, the misaligned incentives for the instructors and the security expert made it difficult to sustain this intervention without organizational support. By identifying limitations in our intervention, we suggest ideas for sustaining it.</p>

      <p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a promising solution to improve the transparency of machine learning (ML) pipelines. We systematize the increasingly growing (but fragmented) microcosm of studies that develop and utilize XAI methods for defensive and offensive cybersecurity tasks. We identify 3 cybersecurity stakeholders, i.e., model users, designers, and adversaries, that utilize XAI for 5 different objectives within an ML pipeline, namely 1) XAI-enabled decision support, 2) applied XAI for security tasks, 3) model verification via XAI, 4) explanation verification &amp; robustness, and 5) offensive use of explanations. We further classify the literature w.r.t. the targeted security domain. Our analysis of the literature indicates that many of the XAI applications are designed with little understanding of how they might be integrated into analyst workflows â€“ user studies for explanation evaluation are conducted in only 14% of the cases. The literature also rarely disentangles the role of the various stakeholders. Particularly, the role of the model designer is minimized within the security literature. To this end, we present an illustrative use case accentuating the role of model designers. We demonstrate cases where XAI can help in model verification and cases where it may lead to erroneous conclusions instead. The systematization and use case enable us to challenge several assumptions and present open problems that can help shape the future of XAI within cybersecurity.</p>

    <div class="abstract hidden">
      <p>Sequence clustering in a streaming environment is challenging because it is computationally expensive, and the sequences may evolve over time. K-medoids or Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM)
is commonly used to cluster sequences since it supports alignment-based distances, and the k-centers being actual data items helps with cluster
interpretability. However, offline k-medoids has no support for concept drift, while also being prohibitively expensive for clustering data streams.
We therefore propose SECLEDS, a streaming variant of the k-medoids
algorithm with constant memory footprint. SECLEDS has two unique
properties: i) it uses multiple medoids per cluster, producing stable highquality
clusters, and ii) it handles concept drift using an intuitive Medoid
Voting scheme for approximating cluster distances. Unlike existing adaptive
algorithms that create new clusters for new concepts, SECLEDS follows
a fundamentally different approach, where the clusters themselves
evolve with an evolving stream. Using real and synthetic datasets, we
empirically demonstrate that SECLEDS produces high-quality clusters
regardless of drift, stream size, data dimensionality, and number of clusters.
We compare against three popular stream and batch clustering algorithms.
The state-of-the-art BanditPAM is used as an offline benchmark.
SECLEDS achieves comparable F1 score to BanditPAM while reducing
the number of required distance computations by 83.7%. Importantly,
SECLEDS outperforms all baselines by 138.7% when the stream contains
drift. We also cluster real network traffic, and provide evidence
that SECLEDS can support network bandwidths of up to 1.08 Gbps
while using the (expensive) dynamic time warping distance.</p>

      <p>Attack graphs (AG) are used to assess pathways availed by cyber adversaries to penetrate a network. State-of-the-art approaches for AG generation focus mostly on deriving dependencies between system vulnerabilities based on network scans and expert knowledge. In real-world operations however, it is costly and ineffective to rely on constant vulnerability scanning and expert-crafted AGs. We propose to automatically learn AGs based on actions observed through intrusion alerts, without prior expert knowledge. Specifically, we develop an unsupervised sequence learning system, SAGE, that leverages the temporal and probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton (S-PDFA) â€“ a model that accentuates infrequent severe alerts and summarizes paths leading to them. AGs are then derived from the
S-PDFA on a per-objective, per-victim basis. Tested with intrusion alerts collected through Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition, SAGE compresses over 330k alerts into 93 AGs. These AGs reflect the strategies used by the participating teams. The AGs are succinct, interpretable, and capture behavioral dynamics, e.g., that attackers will often follow shorter paths to re-exploit objectives.</p>

      <p>We present a method to learn automaton models that are more robust to input modifications. It iteratively aligns sequences to a learned model, modifies the sequences to their aligned versions, and re-learns the model. Automaton learning algorithms are typically very good at modeling the frequent behavior of a software system. Our solution can be used to also learn the behavior present in infrequent sequences, as these will be aligned to the frequent ones represented by the model. We apply our method to the SAGE tool for modeling attacker behavior from intrusion alerts. In experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns models that can handle noise such as added and removed symbols from sequences. Furthermore, it learns more concise models that fit better to the training data.</p>

      <p>Training classifiers that are robust against adversarially modified examples is becoming
increasingly important in practice. In the field of malware detection, adversaries
modify malicious binary files to seem benign while preserving their malicious behavior.
We report on the results of a recently held robust malware detection challenge. There
were two tracks in which teams could participate: the attack track asked for adversarially
modified malware samples and the defend track asked for trained neural network classifiers
that are robust to such modifications. The teams were unaware of the attacks/defenses
they had to detect/evade. Although only 9 teams participated, this unique setting
allowed us to make several interesting observations.We also present the challenge
winner: GRAMS, a family of novel techniques to train adversarially robust networks
that preserve the intended (malicious) functionality and yield high-quality adversarial
samples. These samples are used to iteratively train a robust classifier. We show
that our techniques, based on discrete optimization techniques, beat purely gradient-based
methods. GRAMS obtained first place in both the attack and defend tracks of the competition.</p>

      <p>Network data clustering and sequential data mining are large fields of research, but how to combine them to analyze spatial-temporal network data remains a technical challenge. This study investigates a novel combination of two sequential similarity methods (Dynamic Time Warping and N-grams with Cosine distances), with two state-of-the-art unsupervised network clustering algorithms (Hierarchical Density-based Clustering and Stochastic Block Models). A popular way to combine such methods is to first cluster the sequential network data, resulting in connection types. The hosts in the network can then be clustered conditioned on these types. In contrast, our approach clusters nodes and edges in one go, i.e., without giving the output of a first clustering step as input for a second step. We achieve this by implementing sequential distances as covariates for host clustering. While being fully unsupervised, our method outperforms many existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, the only approaches with comparable performance require manual filtering of connections and feature engineering steps. In contrast, our method is applied to raw network traffic. We apply our pipeline to the problem of detecting infected hosts (network nodes) from logs of unlabelled network traffic (sequential data). On data from the Stratosphere IPS project (CTU-Malware-Capture-Botnet-91), which includes malicious (Conficker botnet) as well as benign hosts, we show that our method perfectly detects peripheral, benign, and malicious hosts in different clusters. We replicate our results in the well-known ISOT dataset (Storm, Waledac, Zeus botnets) with comparable performance: conjointly, 99.97% of nodes were categorized correctly.</p>

      <p>Ideal cyber threat intelligence (CTI) includes insights into attacker strategies that are specific to a network under observation. Such CTI currently requires extensive expert input for obtaining, assessing, and correlating system vulnerabilities into a graphical representation, often referred to as an attack graph (AG). Instead of deriving AGs based on system vulnerabilities, this work advocates the direct use of intrusion alerts. We propose SAGE, an explainable sequence learning pipeline that automatically constructs AGs from intrusion alerts without a priori expert knowledge. SAGE exploits the temporal and probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton (S-PDFA) â€” a model that brings infrequent severe alerts into the spotlight and summarizes paths leading to them. Attack graphs are extracted from the model on a per-victim, per-objective basis. SAGE is thoroughly evaluated on three open-source intrusion alert datasets collected through security testing competitions in order to analyze distributed multi-stage attacks. SAGE compresses over 330k alerts into 93 AGs that show how specific attacks transpired. The AGs are succinct, interpretable, and provide directly relevant insights into strategic differences and fingerprintable paths. They even show that attackers tend to follow shorter paths after they have discovered a longer one in 84.5% of the cases.</p>

      <p>The evolving nature of the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by cyber adversaries have made signature and template based methods of modeling adversary behavior almost infeasible. We are moving into an era of data-driven autonomous cyber defense agents that learn contextually meaningful adversary behaviors from observables. In this chapter, we explore what can be learnt about cyber adversaries from observable data, such as intrusion alerts, network traffic, and threat intelligence feeds. We describe the challenges of building autonomous cyber defense agents, such as learning from noisy observables with no ground truth, and the brittle nature of deep learning based agents that can be easily evaded by adversaries. We illustrate three state-of-the-art autonomous cyber defense agents that model adversary behavior from traffic induced observables without a priori expert knowledge or ground truth labels. We close with recommendations and directions for future work.</p>

      <p>This chapter contributes to the ongoing discussion of strengthening security by applying AI techniques in the scope of intrusion detection. The focus is set on open-world detection of attacks through
data-driven network traffic analysis. This research topic is complementary to the earlier chapter on intelligent malware detection. In this chapter, we revisit the foundations of machine learning-based
solutions for network security, which aim to make network defense tools more autonomous, adaptive, proactive and responsive. Specifically, we
give a comprehensive introduction to the research on anomaly detection for network intrusion detection â€“ that is, defensive schemes that do
not assume complete prior knowledge of malicious patterns and instead learn the notion of normality from benign traffic. Along with outlining the recent advances in the field, we provide insights and reflect on
the current limitations and research challenges. Therefore, this chapter presents compelling research opportunities to advance machine learning
techniques in network security and push the boundaries of open-world network intrusion detection.</p>

      <p>Malware family labels are known to be inconsistent. They are also black-box since they do not represent the capabilities of malware. The current state of the art in malware capability assessment includes mostly manual approaches, which are infeasible due to the ever-increasing volume of discovered malware samples. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning-based method called MalPaCA, which automates capability assessment by clustering the temporal behavior in malwareâ€™s network traces. MalPaCA provides meaningful behavioral clusters using only 20 packet headers. Behavioral profiles are generated based on the cluster membership of malwareâ€™s network traces. A Directed Acyclic Graph shows the relationship between malwares according to their overlapping behaviors. The behavioral profiles together with the DAG provide more insightful characterization of malware than current family designations. We also propose a visualization-based evaluation method for the obtained clusters to assist practitioners in understanding the clustering results. We apply MalPaCA on a financial malware dataset collected in the wild that comprises 1.1Â k malware samples resulting in 3.6Â M packets. Our experiments show that (i) MalPaCA successfully identifies capabilities, such as port scans and reuse of Command and Control servers; (ii) It uncovers multiple discrepancies between behavioral clusters and malware family labels; and (iii) It demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering traces using temporal features by producing an error rate of 8.3%, compared to 57.5% obtained from statistical features.</p>

      <p>Attack graphs (AG) are a popular area of research that display all the paths an attacker can exploit to penetrate a network. Existing techniques for AG generation rely heavily on expert input regarding vulnerabilities and network topology. In this work, we advocate the use of AGs that are built directly using the actions observed through intrusion alerts, without prior expert input.We have developed an unsupervised visual analytics system, called SAGE, to learn alert-driven attack graphs.We show how these AGs (i) enable forensic analysis of prior attacks, and (ii) enable proactive defense by providing relevant threat intelligence regarding attacker strategies. We believe that alert-driven AGs can play a key role in AI-enabled cyber threat intelligence as they open up new avenues for attacker strategy analysis whilst reducing analyst workload.</p>

      <p>Understanding the behavior of cyber adversaries provides threat intelligence to security 
practitioners, and improves the cyber readiness of an organization. With the rapidly 
evolving threat landscape, data-driven solutions are becoming essential for automatically 
extracting behavioral patterns from data that are otherwise too time-consuming 
to discover manually. This dissertation advocates the use of machine learning (ML) to 
obtain insights into adversary behavior for creating AI-assisted practitioners. However, 
developing adversary behavior models is challenging since cyber data is often unlabeled, 
noisy, infrequent, and contains intricate patterns that evolve over time. We demonstrate 
that sequential features are effective at addressing these challenges. Yet, they have limited 
interpretability and algorithmic support. This dissertation starts by defining the notion of explainability as it is currently used 
within cybersecurity by systematizing available literature in Chapter 2. We find that 
the literature frequently relies on black-box models that use off-the-shelf explanation 
methods without considering the explanation stakeholders. In contrast, literature on 
sequence learning models that are interpretable by design is severely limited. 
We address these challenges by developing special algorithms that learn sequential 
patterns from infrequent events, and evolving data in an unsupervised setting. We utilize 
these algorithms to create interpretable tool-chains for understanding the behavior of 
various types of adversaries. We show that it is possible to learn interpretable models 
(even for complex sequential data in an unsupervised setting) that providemore insights 
than just prediction probabilities, while achieving competitive performance. In doing 
so, we encourage the security community to look beyond accuracy scores, and focus on 
extracting actionable insights fromMLmodels. We make our tool-chains open-source. The first part of this thesis models the strategies 
employed by human threat actors. 
Chapters 3 and 4 develop a novel paradigmof attack graphs (AG) that are learned directly 
fromintrusion alerts for capturing attacker strategies. The attacker strategies are learned 
using our S-PDFA model, which is interpretable, fast, and effective. We learn alert-driven 
AGs from 3 open-source datasets, and show their ability to compress over 1.4 million 
alerts in 401 AGs in under 5 minutes. The AGs provide actionable intelligence regarding 
strategic differences and fingerprintable paths. They also reduce analyst alert fatigue by 
triaging critical attacks. The second part of the thesis models the capabilities exhibited by automated threat 
actors (malware). Chapters 5 and 6 develop an explainable sequence clustering toolchain 
to automatically characterize the network behavior of malware samples. We use 
this tool-chain to create behavioral profiles of 1196 real-world malware samples that explain 
their capabilities. We also develop a streaming sequence clustering algorithm for 
real-time behavior profiling, which is evaluated on 5 datasets and against 4 clustering 
algorithms. By automatically creating behavioral profiles of bot-infected hosts in realtime, 
we distinguish benign and malicious hosts with 100% accuracy.</p>

      <p>Developing malware variants is extremely cheap for attackers because of the availability of various obfuscation tools. 
	These variants can be grouped in malware families, based on information retrieved from their static and dynamic analysis. 
	Dynamic, network-level analysis of malware shows its core behavior since it captures the interaction with its developer. 
	On the other hand, increasingly more emphasis is given to using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) in order to cluster malwareâ€™s network behavior. 
	However, DPI has severe privacy implications, as it involves inspecting payloads of the network traffic. This thesis presents an exploratory study, 
	the aim of which is to characterize and cluster malware behavior using high-level, non-privacy-invasive, sequential features extracted from its network activity. 
	The key intuition behind the proposed solution is that if the underlying infrastructure of distinct malware samples is similar, 
	the order in which they perform certain actions should also be similar. The results of this research show that sequence clustering allows flexible and 
	robust clusters, as opposed to using non-sequential features. The clusters themselves reveal interesting attacking capabilities, 
	such as port scans, and the same Command and Control server responding to different malware families. Lastly, a comparison with clusters obtained 
	from static analysis reveals that network-based clustering is far more qualified to determine the many behaviors exhibited by a single malware family, 
	as well as behaviors common across multiple malware families.</p>
